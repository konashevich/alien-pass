Problems:
1. On Android: "Backup" does not work.
2. On web: In "Master password" field - it should not offer generation of a secure password by Google Chrome Password Manager (or Brave Password manager).
3. On web: "Login" field should not remember any input text in it. 
4. On Android/Web: When Save login? checked add Two optional fields to fill in: Name and Domains. Also make sure if Name is left blank then include Domain there by default, and only if the Domain left blank then put login there.

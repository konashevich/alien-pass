# AlienPass

Offline password generator with a local vault. Ships as a static web app and can be packaged into a fully offline Android APK using Capacitor.

## Features

- 100% offline: all assets are bundled locally; no network required
- Local vault stored in the WebView (IndexedDB)
- Simple static build — works in any modern browser or as an Android app

## Project layout

- `www/` — web app source served by Capacitor (contains `index.html`, scripts, icons)
- `android/` — native Android wrapper project generated by Capacitor
- Root files (`index.html`, `alienpass.js`, etc.) may mirror `www/` for hosting; `webDir` is set to `www` for packaging

## Requirements (Linux)

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Java JDK 17 (or 11)
- Android SDK + build-tools (via Android Studio or `sdkmanager`)
- Android SDK path configured via either:
  - `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable, or
  - `android/local.properties` file with: `sdk.dir=/absolute/path/to/Android/Sdk`

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Run on the web

Because this is a static app, you can:

- Open `www/index.html` directly in a browser, or
- Serve the `www/` folder with any static server

Tip: When packaging with Capacitor you usually modify files in `www/`, then copy to native.

## Android packaging (Capacitor)

Add Android (already done in this repo, but for reference):

```bash
npx cap add android
```

Copy web assets to the native project whenever you change files in `www/`:

```bash
npx cap copy android
```

Build APK via Android Studio (GUI):

```bash
npx cap open android
```

Then choose Build > Build APK(s).

Build APK via CLI/Gradle:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK will be in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

## Configuration

- App id and name are in `capacitor.config.json`
- `webDir` is `www` — ensure it contains `index.html`
- Native service workers are disabled in WebViews — not needed since assets are local

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Please keep the app offline-first and avoid adding CDN dependencies.
